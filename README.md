# The company: 
If you enjoy building technology that will be used by other developers, then this could be the one for you. My client offers a platform to other companies who require a real time platform for a range of different problems (Chat, Video Streaming, VR, IoT, Gambling). Their platform is globally distributed and offers real time data streaming and is primarily used by companies whose products require a real time element.

You will be joining a small London development team working directly with the CTO and another developer (supported by remote teams in a variety of locations). Your role will be working directly on the core platform with chances to solve problems at a scale on a globally distributed platform. Whilst you will need to be super smart and a proven quick study you will also be supported by experienced developers. This is a chance to work on some of the most interesting problems in computing.
# The role: 
Primarily developing in Node.JS this position would be most suitable for someone who has a broad range of technical interests. Node.JS, Ruby, GO and Elixir are some of the languages already in use and the team are always experimenting to see which languages are best suited for the writing of new services. 
# Problem examples: 

   -  How do you reliably definite state across a large distributed application?
   -  Why is 99.99% uptime not good enough and can it be improved?
   -  Scaling issues on a distributed application 

# What experience is required?

-	Strong theoretical knowledge of computer science
-	Previous experience of working on a distributed system 
-	Programming experience in more than one language and an openness to learning more
